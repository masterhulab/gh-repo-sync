# Downloaded Repositories (optional, depending on use case, but good to ignore root level folders that might be clones)
# Since the script allows custom directories, we can't ignore everything, but we can ignore common patterns if needed.
# For now, let's assume the user manages their own downloaded repos or puts them in a subdir.
